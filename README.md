# Medicaid & CHIP Quality Measures Dashboard

This project explores the quality of healthcare delivery across U.S. states in 2022, using data from Medicaid and CHIP (Children's Health Insurance Program) performance measures (retrieved from data.gov). The final product is an interactive dashboard built in Tableau.

## 📊 Project Summary

- Separated the data into six healthcare domains:
  - Maternal and Prenatal Health
  - Primary Care Access
  - Dental and Oral Health
  - Acute and Chronic Conditions
  - Behavioral Health
  - Long-Term Services and Supports
- Built a **Tableau dashboard** featuring:
  - A dot plot comparing state-level performance per quality measure
  - A geomap to explore participation and reporting completeness
  - Bar charts highlighting states’ best and worst performing measures

## 🛠 Tools Used

- **SAS** – data cleaning and transformation
- **Tableau** – data visualization and dashboard creation

## 🧠 Key Insights
